I am a third-year PhD student at the School of Computer Science in Peking University (2022-). I am advised by [Prof. Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/) and my research interests are Information Elicitation, Blockchain and other subareas in Computational Economics. I am currently visiting Northwestern University in 2025 as a pre-doctoral research fellow, under the supervision of Prof. Jason Hartline.
