I am a third-year PhD student at the School of Computer Science in Peking University (2022-). I am advised by [Prof. Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/) and my research interests are Information Elicitation, Blockchain and other subareas in Computational Economics.

## News

[Shengwei](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/shengwei-xu) and I presented a tutorial named "Information Elicitation Meets Large Language Models: Progress, Opportunities, and Challenge" at WINE 2024! **You can find the materials [here](https://yxlu.me/projects/llm_elicitation_wine24)**.
